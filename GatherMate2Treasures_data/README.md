# Gathermate2Treasures_data

This contains data for all the treasures as of 10.0.2 patch.

I will *STRONGLY* encourage to use filtering function and filter out dirt and explorer chests as well as magic-bound chests.

Some are invisible unless you have the reputation

Dirt and explorer packs are so densely packed they cover everything else on the map
