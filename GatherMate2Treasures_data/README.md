# Gathermate2Treasures_data

This contains data for all the treasures as of 10.0.2 patch.

I will *STRONGLY* encourage to use filtering function and filter out dirt and explorer packs unless you're actively searching for them, they are so densely packed they cover everything else on the map

Magic-bound chests and dirt are also invisible unless you have the reputation, but they do show up on the minimap as a treasure icon... The chests and caches are untracked on the map thus the need for data

# Installation

Copy The contents of the TreasureData.lua file into GatherMate2TreasuresTreasureDB section of GatherMate2Treasures.lua file 

```
GatherMate2TreasuresTreasureDB = {
	[2022] = {
		[1500944000] = 566,
		[1500944001] = 567,
....
....

		[6690582001] = 567,
	},
}
```
