# Gathermate2Treasures

This is a fork of Gathermate2 focusing only on Dragonflight treasures portion that are not being tracked by the original

This is my low-effort attempt at tracking currently untracked treasure nodes

Use the original https://github.com/Nevcairiel/GatherMate2 for all other tracking

Minimal effort will be put into maintaining

# Localization (Translation of Nodes)

This is English only and will likely break in other locales due to missing localization files. 

# Other

* I've included the data for treasures in the ```GatherMate2Treasures_data``` folder, there are bare-bone instructions on how to 'import' it in that folder

* If you use MBB (MiniMap Button Bag) you'll need to modify MBB.lua (around line 112) to show minimap nodes
